# RealTimeRecordLinkage
Real-time record linkage software created and used by the ALPHA Network managed by LSHTM (http://alpha.lshtm.ac.uk/) 

# How to get started
Download the Kisesa Record Linkage_User Guide_vGitHub.docx file. There are install and setup instructions in the annex of this file. 

# Fake data and example searches
There are fake data saved as "fake100" in three different formats for your convenience. If you would like to test the software using these fake data, you will find an excel workbook called ExampleSearches.xlsx that gives you an idea of how the software operates.

# SQL files
There are several SQL scripts. The SQL files that begin with S# (e.g, SO, S1, S2, etc.) are used during installation and setup of software. CreateUpdateUsers.sql is used to create log-in credentials to the software. ExportScript_bak.sql and ImportScript_bak.sql are used to import and export data collected in the software.
